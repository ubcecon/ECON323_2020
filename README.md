# Course materials for ECON323 Winter 2020

Previous **programming experience** and classwork is useful, but **not required**.  But even if you know how to program, you will learn a great deal of interesting applications.

We will follow the [QuantEcon DataScience](https://datascience.quantecon.org/) textbook

## Computational Setup

You will not need to install any software on your local computer.  Instead:
- Go to the [QuantEcon DataScience Introduction](https://datascience.quantecon.org/introduction/) textbook.
- One time setup: click on the "Settings" icon at the bottom of a lecture and choose the server: ubc.syzygy.ca 
- Then click on the "Launch Notebook" to launch any notebook in your computing environment
- See [Troubleshooting](https://datascience.quantecon.org/introduction/troubleshooting.html) for how to reset notebooks, etc.
- We strongly suggest creating a GitHub account and signing up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack/)

If possible, please bring a laptop to class to interactively discuss the material.
